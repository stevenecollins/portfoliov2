		<h1>The Contacts area within the Field App -</h1>
		<p>
			The web application's CRM (Customer Relationship Manager) feature allows
			customers to manage all the data and communications with their former,
			current, and future customers, adjusters, vendors, and suppliers.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="container content">
		<h3>Why was the redesign needed?</h3>
		<li class="bullet">
			<span>&#10112;</span> Customer support received numerous calls and emails
			about the ineffectiveness of the contacts feature in the mobile
			application.
		</li>
		<li class="bullet">
			<span>&#10113;</span> The current contacts mobile feature was built to
			replicate the web experience and needed new designs that were optimized
			for the mobile experience.
		</li>
		<li class="bullet">
			<span>&#10114;</span> Many users were unaware of all the features
			available to them in contacts because they were hidden several layers
			deep.
		</li>
	</div>

	<div class="container content">
		<h3>RESEARCH - Learn About the Affected Users</h3>
		<p>
			We needed to learn about our affected user's frustrations. So we
			interviewed a group of users and created personas and journey maps that
			were used during the redesign process.

		<h3>What We Learned?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span>&#187;</span>
				Users were unaware of some of the features within contacts. The users
				were using the contacts differently than intended in the original
				designs because of how the information was displayed.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span>&#187;</span>
				The UI lacked consistency which led to a cluttered design that was
				difficult to navigate.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span>&#187;</span>
				When researching, we discovered two main requirements within the
				contacts areaâ€”viewing past interactions and adding new notes or calling
				logs when interacting with the contact.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span>&#187;</span>
				We also learned that many actions our users wanted to complete required
				going through many layers within the application.
			</li>
			<li>
				<span>&#187;</span>
				We also learned that many of the useful actions within contacts required
				navigating several layers deep within the feature.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>The Redesign</h3>
		<p>
			Below is a side-by-side comparison of the old contacts design and the
			newly redesigned version of the feature. A few of the fundamental changes
			that were made included a redesigned UI that relocated many of the useful
			actions that were hidden several layers deep within menus.

		<h3>Now We Test.</h3>
		<p>
			We took the designs we created from our research and created a clickable
			prototype for testing our hypotheses.

		<h3>Testing Process</h3>
		<p>
			After creating a list of questions to ask our users, we observed and noted
			how our customers interacted with our new designs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our test included one interviewer and a few observers that sent questions
			to the interviewer to reduce confusion.

		<h3>What's Next?</h3>
		<p>
			After our testing outcome and presentation to the company Stakeholders, we
			received the green light to start the developer handoff.

		<h3>File Prep for Developers</h3>

		<h2>Miro Document</h2>
		<p>
			The Miro document is our primary file for the team that can answer any
			Developer or QA questions and act as a reference guide to help document
			why certain design decisions were made.
