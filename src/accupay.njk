			<span>This is AccuPay</span>, an AccuLynx Mobile Payment application for
			collecting secure online payments at the job location. The main
			requirement for the application was the inclusion of ACH and Credit Card
			processing. These additions needed to worked seamlessly with the desktop
			application by automatically updating the job information and notifying
			any required users of the completed transaction.

		<h3>We Started with Research:</h3>
		<p>
			We first developed some questions we needed answers to understand the
			user's needs for this product feature:
		</p>
		<p>
			Who will use the AccuPay app? Why? What tasks needed to be completed? What
			features do the users want?
		</p>

			<strong>Who is Doug Cash?</strong><br />
			Doug is a Retail Roofing Business owner who needs a way to collect payment
			without waiting for the customer to send a check. The ideal workflow was
			collecting payment on completion of the final walk-through at the end of
			the project.

		<h3>Market research came next.</h3>
		<p>
			Based on our research, we developed more educated questions to help us
			further understand the best approach for designing a strong user
			experience:
		</p>
		<p>
			What are other applications doing to collect payment promptly? What are
			some roadblocks? What's working for them? What's not?
		</p>
		<h4>A couple of key points we discovered through our research:</h4>
		<li class="bullet">
			<span>&#10112;</span> There are a lot of card service providers that have
			found success doing similar things AccuPay is trying to accomplish.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>&#10113;</span> The feeling of safety and security for our users
			needs to be a top priority, otherwise they will not feel comfortable using
			the app to complete transactions.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>&#10114;</span> Users have little patience for similar apps that do
			not quickly and effectively behave as expected. A user will quit the app
			quickly if they become frustrated

		<h3>An Interesting note:</h3>
		<p>
			After testing the user flow with a few of our AccuLynx customers, we
			needed to make a few tweaks to allow the user to enter the card details
			manually. The business initially thought the user would not want to
			manually enter the ACH payments because of the higher processing fees.
		</p>
		<p>
			The application needed to allow the user to collect a payment quickly and
			email a receipt after processing. The application needed to be simple and
			intuitive for our users.. I looked at other designs for inspiration and
			sorted out what worked to fit the desired outcome.

		<h3>The Design.</h3>
		<p>After a few iterations we came to the completed design below.</p>

	<div class="container content">
		<h3>What's Next?</h3>
		<p>
			The application has been in the wild for a little over a year. We added a
			nice adoption rate, adding another revenue stream for AccuLynx. Moving
			forward, we will use our heap reports and customer comments to see if any
			future user experience updates are needed.
